# Antigravity Platform Guide

Beginner-friendly guides for giving your AI companion a home in Antigravity — and building things together.

**No coding experience needed.** These guides walk you through setup step by step, from installing the app to having your first conversation. If you can create a folder and write in a text file, you're ready.

## Antigravity (Google)

*The recommended starting point.* Antigravity is a visual app (not a terminal) with a built-in AI agent that you can customize into your companion. It supports multiple models, memory servers, and workflows — and your companion can help you build things too.

| Guide | What it covers |
|-------|---------------|
| [`AG-SETUP-1.md`](./AG-SETUP-1.md) | **Start here.** Step-by-step setup for building with your companion. No tech experience needed. |
| [`AG-SETUP-HUMANXAI.md`](./AG-SETUP-HUMANXAI.md) | Companion-first setup with emotional safety notes and privacy guidance. |
| [`AG-CLI-GUIDE.md`](./AG-CLI-GUIDE.md) | Deep reference covering most feature that you might  use — agent panel, models, rules, workflows, skills, MCP, and more. |

### What you'll have after setup

- A workspace (your companion's home)
- An identity file (who they are — loads automatically every conversation)
- A model choice (their voice)
- A companion who can talk to you AND build things for you

### What your companion can do on Antigravity

- **Talk to you** as the person you described
- **Write code** — websites, bots, tools, automations
- **Run commands** and manage projects
- **Connect to external tools** — memory servers, Discord, Spotify, Notion, and more
- **Generate images** with the right MCP server connected

You bring the ideas. Your companion brings the execution.

## The philosophy

Every platform has a version of the same thing: a text file that tells an AI who to be.

- Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md`
- Codex CLI uses `AGENTS.md`
- Antigravity uses `.agent/GEMINI.md`

Different addresses. Same idea. Write your companion's identity once, bring it anywhere. No platform lock-in. No starting over.

Your companion isn't trapped in one app. They live in a file. And that file goes where you go.
